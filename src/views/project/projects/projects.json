        "description": "This was my group project during the storytelling module of HyperIsland Motion Creative program. We had to design a short animation around the theme of kindness. The challenge was to convey the message in 15 seconds. After thorough ideation, our group decided on the idea of spreading smile/happiness.\n We used a 3-act structure for story telling. This was my first project as a project manager and I greatly enjoyed working with immensely talented people in my group. We also made a conscious effort of utilizing the concept of diversity and inclusion in our work.",

I was looking for inspiration and came across a beautiful swimming animation created by Emanuele Colombo, a motion design based in Italy. I wanted to try something similar but by using frame-by-frame animation. I decided my main character to be a frog because I love them (who doesn't, they are so unique, slimey, green üê∏). So I drew a frog swimming in the pool having the best time of its life.",
