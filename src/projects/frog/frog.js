        to create a loop animation of choice. I was looking for inspiration and 
        came across a beautiful swimming animation created by Emanuele Colombo, 
        a motion design based in Italy. I wanted to try something similar but 
        by using frame-by-frame animation. I decided my main character to be 
        a frog because I love them (who doesn't, they are so unique, slimey, 
        green üê∏). So I drew a frog swimming in the pool having the best time 
        of its life.`;
